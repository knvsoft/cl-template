# Contributing Guidelines

## General Feedback

Create a new issue on our [Issues page](https://github.com/knvsoft/cl-template/issues).


### Issue reports

Update Contacts Lister to the latest version and make sure that the issue you are having is also present in the latest version.

If possible, attach screenshots or screencasts of the issue you encounter. It is also helpful to attach sample files that can reproduce the issue.


### Feature requests

First, search for existing feature requests. If your idea is already posted, comment on that thread. Otherwise, create a new one using the “Feature request” template.
Instead of listing multiple features in a single post, create an issue for each feature.

Please refrain from simply adding “+1” or similar comments to existing requests; it serves no purpose and contributes to unnecessary clutter.
